# AI-driven-Personalized-Recipe-Generator
### Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to create an AI-powered application that generates personalized recipes based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and ingredient availability. We'll use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and generate recipes that align with the user's requirements.

### Steps to Follow:

- **Data Collection:** Gather a dataset of recipes, including ingredients, instructions, and any other relevant information. You can use publicly available datasets or scrape data from recipe websites.<br>
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the dataset to remove any irrelevant information, handle missing values, and ensure consistency in formatting.<br>
- **Text Generation Model:** Train a text generation model using deep learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers. This model will learn to generate recipes based on the input provided.<br>
- **User Interaction:** Develop a user interface (UI) where users can input their preferences, dietary restrictions, and ingredient availability.<br>
- **Recipe Generation:** Use the trained model to generate personalized recipes based on the user input. The model should consider factors like taste preferences, cooking skill level, and available ingredients.<br>
- **Deployment:** Deploy the application so that users can access it online. You can use platforms like Heroku or AWS for deployment.<br>
